The 100 participants in the data set are the students who were enrolled in Ihno’s sections, and voluntarily consented to be in her study, which was approved by the appropriate review board at her hypothetical school. Her data were collected on two different days. On the ﬁrst day of classes, the students who came to one of Ihno’s sections ﬁlled in a brief background questionnaire on which they provided contact information, some qualitative data (gender, undergrad major, why they had enrolled in statistics (reason), and whether they have a habit of drinking coffee), and some quantitative data (number of math courses already completed (prevmath), the score they received on a diagnostic math background quiz they were all required to take before registering for statistics mathquiz, and a rating of their math phobia on a scale from 0 to 10). You will see that, due to late registration and other factors, not all of Ihno’s students took the diagnostic math background quiz. The rest of Ihno’s data were collected as part of an experiment that she conducted during her recitation sessions on one day in the middle of the semester. (The one exception is that her students took a regular 10 question quiz the week before her experiment (statquiz), and she decided to add those scores to her data set.) At the beginning of the experiment, Ihno explained how each student could take his or her own pulse. She then provided a half-minute interval during which they counted the number of beats, and then wrote down twice that number as their heart rate (hr_base) in beats per minute (bpm). Then, each student reported how many cups of coffee they had consumed since waking up that morning (num_cups), and ﬁlled out an anxiety questionnaire consisting of 10 items, each rated (0 to 4) on a 5-point Likertscale. Total scores could range from 0 to 40, and provided a measure of baseline anxiety (anx_base). Next, Ihno announced a pop quiz. She handed out a page containing 11 multiple-choice statistics questions on material covered during the preceding two weeks, and asked the students to keep this page face down while taking and recording their pulse (hr_pre) and ﬁlling out a anxiety questionnaire (anx_pre). Then Ihno told the students they had 15 minutes to take the fairly difﬁcult quiz. She also told them that the ﬁrst 10 questions were worth 1 point each but that the 11th question was worth 3 points of extra credit. Ihno’s experimental manipulation consisted of varying the difﬁculty of the 11th question. Twenty-ﬁve quizzes were distributed at each level of difﬁculty of the ﬁnal question: easy, moderate, difﬁcult, and impossible to solve (exp_cond). After the quizzes were collected, Ihno asked the students to provide heart rate and anxiety data one more time (hr_post, anx_post). Finally, Ihno explained the experiment, adding that the 11th quiz question would not be scored and that, although the students would get back their quizzes with their score for the ﬁrst 10 items (statquiz), that score would not inﬂuence their grade for the statistics course.

The haven package is downloaded as part of the tidyverse set of packages, but is not automatically loaded. It must have its own library() function call (see above).

Before you can run the t Test, you must seperate out or ‘PULL’ your variable out of the dataset. Use the dplyr::pull(continuous_variable)step befor running the t Test Inside the funtion you need to specify one option: the null-hypothesis value: mu = ## (replace with your number) You MAY need/want to specify some or all of the following options you may way to leave as the default or override: Number of tails: alternative = “two.sided” Default Allows for a 2-sided alternative alternative = “less” Only Allows: group 1 &lt; group 2 alternative = “greater” Only Allows: group 1 &gt; group 2 Confidence level: conf.level = 0.95 Default Computes the 95% confidence inverval conf.level = 0.90 Changes to a 90% confidence interval 3.3.1 All Defaults Is there evidence the population mean weight is DIFFERENT than 165? cancer_clean %&gt;% dplyr::pull(weighin) %&gt;% # pull the continuous varaible out t.test(mu = 165) # specify the null hypothesis value One Sample t-test data: . t = 2.0765, df = 24, p-value = 0.04872 alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 165 95 percent confidence interval: 165.0807 191.4793 sample estimates: mean of x 178.28 There is evidence that cancer patients weight more (N = 25, M = 178.28) now than the historic average of 165 pound, \\(t(24) = 2.077, p = .049, 95% CI: 165.08, 191.48\\). 3.3.2 Confidence Level other than 95% Find a 99% confience level for the population mean weight. cancer_clean %&gt;% dplyr::pull(weighin) %&gt;% # pull the continuous varaible out t.test(mu = 165, # specify the null hypothesis value conf.level = 0.99) # over-ride the default of 95% CI One Sample t-test data: . t = 2.0765, df = 24, p-value = 0.04872 alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 165 99 percent confidence interval: 160.3927 196.1673 sample estimates: mean of x 178.28 There is evidence that cancer patients weight more (N = 25, M = 178.28) now than the historic average of 165 pound, \\(t(24) = 2.077, p = .049, 99% CI: 160.39, 196.17\\). 3.3.3 One-Sided Test, instead of Two Is there evidence the population mean weight is GREATER than 165? cancer_clean %&gt;% dplyr::pull(weighin) %&gt;% # pull the continuous varaible out t.test(mu = 165, # specify the null hypothesis value alternative = &quot;greater&quot;) # over-ride the default of 95% CI One Sample t-test data: . t = 2.0765, df = 24, p-value = 0.02436 alternative hypothesis: true mean is greater than 165 95 percent confidence interval: 167.3384 Inf sample estimates: mean of x 178.28 Notice than one end of the confidence interval is Inf for infinity.

Can not for with any statistically test If idenpendence is violated, you may want to use a paired-samples t-test 4.2.2 Normality A variable is said to follow the normal distribution if it resembles the normal curve. Specifically it is symetrical, unimodal, and bell shaped. The continuous variable has a NORMAL distribution in BOTH populations Not as important if the sample is large (Central Limit Theorem) IF the sample is far from normal &amp;/or small, might want to use a different method Options to judging normality: Visualization of each sample’s distribution Stacked histograms, but is sensitive to binning choices (number or width) Side-by-side boxplots, shows median instead of mean as central line Seperate QQ plots (straight \\(45^\\circ\\) line), but is sensitive to outliers!

For a independent samples t-test for means, the groups need to have the same amount of spread (SD) in the measure of interest. Use the car:leveneTest() function tests the HOV assumtion.

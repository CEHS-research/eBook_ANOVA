Description of the Study The data set contains part of the data for a study of oral condition of cancer patients conducted at the Mid-Michigan Medical Center. The oral conditions of the patients were measured and recorded at the initial stage, at the end of the second week, at the end of the fourth week, and at the end of the sixth week. The variables age, initial weight and initial cancer stage of the patients were recorded. Patients were divided into two groups at random: One group received a placebo and the other group received aloe juice treatment. Sample size \\(n = 25\\) patients with neck cancer. The treatment is Aloe Juice.

For a independent samples t-test for means, the groups need to have the same amount of spread (SD) in the measure of interest. Use the car:leveneTest() function tests the HOV assumtion. Inside the funtion you need to specify at least three options (sepearated by commas): the formula: continuous_var ~ grouping_var (replace with your variable names) the dataset: data = . to pipe it from above the center: center = “mean” since we are comparing means 2.3.3.1 Baseline Oral Condition Do the participants in the treatment and control groups have the same spread in oral condition at BASELINE? cancer_clean %&gt;% car::leveneTest(totalcin ~ trt, # formula: continuous_var ~ grouping_var data = ., # pipe in the dataset center = &quot;mean&quot;) # The default is &quot;median&quot; Levene&#39;s Test for Homogeneity of Variance (center = &quot;mean&quot;) Df F value Pr(&gt;F) group 1 2.2103 0.1507 23 No violations of homogeneity were detected, \\(F(1, 23) = 2.210, p = .151\\). 2.3.3.2 Four Weeks Oral Condition Do the participants in the treatment and control groups have the same spread in oral condition at the FOURTH WEEK? cancer_clean %&gt;% car::leveneTest(totalcw4 ~ trt, # formula: continuous_var ~ grouping_var data = ., # pipe in the dataset center = &quot;mean&quot;) # The default is &quot;median&quot; Levene&#39;s Test for Homogeneity of Variance (center = &quot;mean&quot;) Df F value Pr(&gt;F) group 1 0 0.995 23 No violations of homogeneity were detected, \\(F(1, 23) = 0, p = .995\\). 2.4 Inference Formal Statistical Test: t-Test for Difference in Independent Group Means Use the same t.test() funtion we have used for a single sample, but speficy a few more options. Inside the funtion you need to specify at least three options (sepearated by commas): the formula: continuous_var ~ grouping_var (replace with your variable names) the dataset: data = . to pipe it from above You MAY need/want to specify some or all of the following options you may way to leave as the default or override: HOV assumed: var.equal = FALSE Default Seperate-Variance test using Welch’s df var.equal = TRUE Pooled-Variance test (if HOV is NOT violated) Number of tails: alternative = “two.sided” Default Allows for a 2-sided alternative alternative = “less” Only Allows: group 1 &lt; group 2 alternative = “more” Only Allows: group 1 &gt; group 2 Independent vs. paired: paired = FALSE Default Conducts an INDEOENDENT groups t-Test paired = TRUE Conducts a PAIRED meausres t-Test Confidence level: conf.level = 0.95 Default Computes the 95% confidence inverval conf.level = 0.90 Changes to a 90% confidence interval 2.4.1 Pooled Variance Test Use when there are no violations of HOV 2.4.1.1 Baseline Oral Condition Do the participants in the treatment group have a different average oral condition at BASELINE, compared to the control group? # Minimal syntax cancer_clean %&gt;% t.test(totalcin ~ trt, # formula: continuous_var ~ grouping_var data = ., # pipe in the dataset var.equal = TRUE) # HOV was violated (option = TRUE) Two Sample t-test data: totalcin by trt t = 0.18566, df = 23, p-value = 0.8543 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -1.185479 1.419245 sample estimates: mean in group Placebo mean in group Aloe Juice 6.571429 6.454545 No evidence of a differnece in mean oral condition at baseline, \\(t(23) = 0.186, p = .854\\). Note: this test may be unreliable due to the non-normality of the samll samples. 2.4.1.2 Four Weeks Oral Condition Do the participants in the treatment group have a different average oral condition at the FOURTH WEEK, compared to the control group? # Fully specified function cancer_clean %&gt;% t.test(totalcw4 ~ trt, # formula: continuous_var ~ grouping_var data = ., # pipe in the dataset var.equal = TRUE, # default: HOV was violated (option = TRUE) alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;, # default: 2 sided (options = &quot;less&quot;, &quot;greater&quot;) paired = FALSE, # default: independent (option = TRUE) conf.level = .95) # default: 95% (option = .9, .90, ect.) Two Sample t-test data: totalcw4 by trt t = -0.34598, df = 23, p-value = 0.7325 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -3.444215 2.457202 sample estimates: mean in group Placebo mean in group Aloe Juice 10.14286 10.63636 No evidence of a differnece in mean oral condition at the fourth week, \\(t(23) = -0.350, p = .733\\). 2.4.2 Seperate Variance Test Use if there are violations of HOV or the samples are difference sizes "],
